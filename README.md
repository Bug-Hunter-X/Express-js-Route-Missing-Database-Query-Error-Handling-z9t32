# Express.js Route Missing Database Query Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling when fetching data from a database. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The issue is that the route handler doesn't gracefully handle potential database errors.  If the query fails for any reason, the app proceeds to the next line without returning an appropriate error to the client. This can lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes, especially when running in production.

The solution involves adding robust error handling to catch and respond to potential issues, enhancing the application's stability and resilience.
